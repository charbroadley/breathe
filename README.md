# Breathe

## The Brief

A personal mini-project undertaken as part of our JavaScript group project ([BreakTime](https://github.com/charbroadley/BreakTime)).
I wanted to experiment with CSS to create an animation. My animation encourages the user to breath in time with its movements, and creates a sense of calm and relaxation.

## How to Use

Breath in time with the animation and zone out for a moment of calm
